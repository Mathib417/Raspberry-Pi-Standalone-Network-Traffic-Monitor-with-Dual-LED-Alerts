# Raspberry Pi Network Traffic Monitor

## 📡 Overview

This project creates a **standalone network traffic monitoring system** using a **Raspberry Pi**. It captures packets periodically, analyzes them, and gives **LED feedback** based on the traffic:

- 🟢 **Green LED** blinks to show **average packet volume**:
  - Slow (10s blink) → ≤250 packets
  - Medium (5s blink) → 251–1000 packets
  - Fast (2s blink) → >1000 packets
- 🔴 **Red LED** turns ON if **TCP traffic >70%** (shows TCP dominance)

Results are **logged locally**, making this a great embedded systems + IoT mini-project.

## ✨ Features

- ⏱️ **10x Periodic Packet Captures** (10 seconds each)
- 📊 **Traffic Analysis**: total packets, TCP/UDP count, top source IP
- 🔦 **LED Feedback** via GPIO
- 📁 **Local Logging**: Saved to `/home/Mathi.b_417/traffic_log.txt`

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Software

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tshark -y
sudo pip3 install RPi.GPIO
```

- Raspberry Pi OS (tested on **Lite Bookworm**)
- `tshark` (for packet capture)
- `RPi.GPIO` (for controlling LEDs)
- Python 3 (pre-installed)

### Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi** (e.g., Pi 4)
- **Green LED** → GPIO 18 (pin 12)
- **Red LED** → GPIO 23 (pin 16)
- 220Ω–330Ω resistors
- Breadboard + Jumper wires

### Wiring

```
GPIO 18 (Pin 12) ---> [Green LED +] ---> [220Ω] ---> GND (Pin 6)
GPIO 23 (Pin 16) ---> [Red LED +] ---> [220Ω] ---> GND (Pin 6)
```

## 📥 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raspberry-pi-traffic-monitor.git
cd raspberry-pi-traffic-monitor
```

> Optional (for tshark):
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G wireshark Mathi.b_417
```

> Virtual environment (optional):
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python3 traffic_monitor_pi.py
# or (with sudo if required)
sudo python3 traffic_monitor_pi.py
```

Follow the prompts:

- Choose your network interface (e.g., `wlan0`)
- Wait for 10 samples to complete

---

## 🔍 What Happens

- 10 captures (10 seconds each, 2s delay)
- Results analyzed and logged
- **Green LED** blinks based on average packet count
- **Red LED** turns on if TCP traffic is dominant (>70%)

---

## 📄 Check Logs

```bash
cat /home/Mathi.b_417/traffic_log.txt
```

## 🧪 Example Output

```
Available network interfaces:
1. wlan0
2. eth0
Select interface number: 1

Starting 10 periodic captures for averaging...

Sample 1/10
Packets captured and saved to /home/Mathi.b_417/capture_142345_22032025.pcap
Analysis for capture:
Total packets: 1200
TCP packets: 900 (75.0%)
UDP packets: 200 (16.7%)
Other packets: 100 (8.3%)
Top source IP: 192.168.23.1

[... 9 more samples ...]

Averaged over 10 samples:
Average packets: 1175.0
Average TCP ratio: 74.5%
🟢 Green LED: fast blinking (2s)
🔴 Red LED: ON (TCP >70%)
Results logged to /home/Mathi.b_417/traffic_log.txt
GPIO cleaned up
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- ❌ **"tshark not found"** → Run: `sudo apt install tshark`
- ❌ **Permission issues** → Run with `sudo` or update group
- ❌ **No packets?** → Check interface is active (`ifconfig`)
- ❌ **LEDs not working?** → Recheck wiring and GPIO pin numbers

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

- Add a **button** to start/stop monitoring
- Include a **buzzer** for audible alerts
- Cloud upload (e.g., Google Drive / Firebase)
- Extend LED feedback duration
